## Popular Graph Databases [Source](https://medium.com/analytics-vidhya/a-brief-look-at-graph-databases-d65b00f9c349)

Graph databases offer some advantages in performance since they use NoSQL based storage mechanisms which makes these databases became scalable and distributed. The most popular graph databases are Neo4J, OrientDB, and Amazon Neptune and there are many more such as TigerGraph, ArangoDB, and AllegroGraph.

    Neo4j

Neo4j is the most-known graph database for general use. It supports large graph structures, as in queries that return hundreds of thousands of relations and more. One can use Neo4j both for free and for pay with enterprise editions.

    OrientDB

OrientDB is an open-source NoSQL database management system. It supports schema-less, schema-full and schema-mixed modes with a strong security profiling system based on users and roles and supports querying.

    Amazon Neptune

Amazon Neptune is a high-performance graph database engine that is able to store a large number of relationships and a very short query time. It supports the property graph model and W3C’s Resource Description Framework (RDF), several query languages like Apache TinkerPop Gremlin and SPARQL.

# Virtuoso

Virtuoso Universal Server is a middleware and database engine hybrid that combines the functionality of a traditional Relational database management system (RDBMS), Object-relational database (ORDBMS), virtual database, RDF, XML, free-text, web application server and file server functionality in a single system. Rather than have dedicated servers for each of the aforementioned functionality realms, Virtuoso is a "universal server"; it enables a single multithreaded server process that implements multiple protocols. The free and open source edition of Virtuoso Universal Server is also known as OpenLink Virtuoso. The software has been developed by OpenLink Software with Kingsley Uyi Idehen and Orri Erling as the chief software architects.
